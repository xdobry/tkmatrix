## tkmatrix ##

It is linear algebra learning program developed initially in 1996 to test and learn matrices computation
for german students.
Currently the are many other free programms that makes the same in better way.

## History ##

I have written the programm initially on Amiga 500 using C++ (See tags and MATIX directory, to get original code)
After that ported to Win3.11, then Win95, then rewritten as Tcl library and implemented GUI in Tk.

The project was many years available and used by german students on my private webspace.
In 2023 I start to review the code and adapt to current versions as fun project.

The most documentation is written in German.
